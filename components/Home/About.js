                  Futures Leaders Summit gathers future STEM leaders from Bosnia
                  and Herzegovina. By establishing an event that will annually
                  gather prosperous changemakers in the field of STEM, we aim to
                  create a strong network that will change the way we perceive
                  the industry and the future of our country&#39;s development.
