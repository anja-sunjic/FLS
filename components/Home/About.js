          <p>
            Futures Leaders Summit gathers future STEM leaders from Bosnia and
            Herzegovina. By establishing an event that will annually gather
            prosperous changemakers in the field of STEM, we aim to create a
            strong network that will change the way we perceive the industry and
            the future of our country&#39;s development.
            <br /> <br />
            This year, we will welcome hundreds of STEM leaders in Tuzla. Become
            a part of a deal-breaker story that will shape today into a new
            tomorrow.
