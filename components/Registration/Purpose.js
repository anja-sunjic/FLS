              All in person attendees will be required to follow the guidelines
              of our health and safety protocol. For in person participation it
              is mandatory to provide one of the following during all three days
              of the event: evidence of full vaccination; or a valid negative
              PCR or antigen test not older than 48h; or proof of COVID-19
              recovery issued by your doctor not older than 6 months. For those
              attendees who would need to do the test, the FLS Organizing Team
              will provide advice and guidelines. <br /> <br /> Read more about
              FLS'21 Health and Safety Protocols here.
