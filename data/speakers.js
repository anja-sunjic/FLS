          destructive effects of pollution and climate change. His research approaches are complemented with innovative teaching methods and his vision is to merge as much of the real world with the class room as
          possible. <br/><br/>Prof. Masic was born in Bosanski Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina, then spent time in Croatia, Italy, and Germany prior to moving to the USA. He went on to study biological materials and chemistry,
