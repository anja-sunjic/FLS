    bio: `Prof. Admir Masic is the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Professor in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His current research focus is on the development of high performance in situ and multi-scale characterization techniques that are able to overcome current research bottlenecks in the investigation of complex hierarchically
          organized materials. In 2012 he received the Young Investigator Award from the German Research Foundation focusing on effects of water on the mechanical properties of collagen-based materials.
          Through this project he laid the groundwork for the development of more effective non-invasive strategies for skin assessment and rejuvenation. <br/><br/>He is also interested in the degradation and
          preservation of cultural artifacts, historical buildings, and civil infrastructure. He studies archaeological materials, and through the integration of advanced characterization and modeling tools, explores ancient
          technologies as a source of inspiration for the development of a new generation of durable and sustainable building materials. He aims to develop engineering solutions that will help mitigate the
          destructive effects of pollution and climate change. His research approaches are complemented with innovative teaching methods and his vision is to merge as much of the real world with the class room as
          possible. <br/><br/>Prof. Masic was born in Bosanski Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina, then spent time in Croatia, Italy, and Germany prior to moving to the USA. He went on to study biological materials and chemistry,
          at the University of Turin in Italy. His undergraduate and master studies were in chemistry and he earned a PhD in Physical Chemistry.`,
