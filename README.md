# FLS

Futures Leaders Summit (FLS) gathers future STEM leaders from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By establishing an event that will annually gather prospective change makers in the field of STEM, we aim to create a strong network that will change the way we perceive the industry and the future of our country's development.

This year, the big idea behind the event is the importance of interdisciplinarity in STEM, and we will welcome STEM students and recent graduates in person in Tuzla combined with an opportunity for numerous other enthusiasts to follow the keynote speakers online. Become a part of a story that will shape today into a new tomorrow.
